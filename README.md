### üîñ The website
________________________________________________________________
An acquaintance whose father had died was looking for a solution to gather online messages of support sent to the family. Most of the existing solutions were too corportate and not very focused on the sole listing of the messages.
I volunteered to quickly set up a responsive Wordpress site that would accept messages via a form, which could be moderated beforehand and then displayed on a single page.
